# Haskell-Basics 
# ⛓️ Onchain Governance Marathon

Welcome to the **Onchain Governance Marathon** — a hands-on coding challenge focused on building a basic decentralized governance system using Haskell!

## 🏁 Goal 

Build a lightweight DAO voting engine in Haskell that supports:

- ✅ Onchain-style proposal creation and voting logic
- 🗳️ Vote tracking per proposal (Yes/No)
- ⏰ A voting deadline or timer for each proposal
- ❌ Prevention of late votes after the timer expires
- ⚖️ Execution logic based on vote results (approve or reject)

## 💡 What You'll Learn

- Core Haskell concepts (data types, pattern matching, monads)
- Basic smart contract-style logic and DAO principles
- How to simulate voting, deadlines, and proposal execution in pure Haskell

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- `Proposal.hs`: Defines proposal data, voting logic, and result handling
- `Timer.hs`: Handles deadline simulation and late vote prevention
- `Main.hs`: Brings it all together and runs the governance loop
